# DOM Manipulator

DOM Manipulator is a synthetic transaction testing tool that uses JavaScript to automate user interactions on a web page. When a web page is loaded, JavaScript can be injected and invoked providing full access to the DOM (Document Object Model). Form fields can be populated, elements can be manipulated and events can be triggered such as clicking a link or submit button. Every time a new page is loaded the JavaScript is invoked with a counter and custom arguments so it knows what actions to perform.

## Features and Functionality

* Inject and invoke JavaScript into the DOM
* Extract and save data from web pages
* Write text files using JavaScript
* Automate web page user interactions
* Secure sensitive data with RSA public-private key pair encryption
* Custom WebBrowser control with Internet Explorer version selection
